# There's a habit of putting random shell scripts into a folder named 'bin' or
# 'ci' at the root of the Git repo. Shell scripts should, in most cases, not
# exist in this repository.  Scripts should be encoded via nix, by being added
# to the `apps` attribute of the flake.nix, and ran via `nix run`.  This way,
# they work every single time and do not depend on the environment where they
# are ran, or require the user to install any additional dependencies.

# Editor Settings and more should not be added as files to root of the repo,
# outside of Nix. Using Nix, you can provide a custom vscodium/vscode or other
# editor binary which uses a specified config via a devshell.
